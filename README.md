# Task Manager

I build this Task Manager as part of my learning journey at the MMS IT, where I gained hands-on experience in creating dynamic and functional web applications.

### Features

* checked/done tasks
* deleting tasks

### Tech Stack
* React for the frontend
* zustand for state management
* Tailwind CSS for styling
* sweetalert2 for the alert box

Thank to the MMS IT
